            <h2>PS5</h2>
            <img src="photos/ps5.jpg" alt="picture of ps5">
            <h3>PROS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazing 4K graphics</li>
                <li>Fast and reliable load times.</li>
                <li>Able to play PS4 games</li>
                <li>Able to play exclusive PlayStation games</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>CONS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Awkward console design, so if you have a gaming set up you should double check if the PS5 can fit in.</li>
                <li>A very expensive price tag of $499 (It is getting cheaper as time goes by, but generally it is around this price)</li>
                <li>Does not work well with older TVs</li>
                <li>Large controllers that feel awkward for some</li>
                <li>Small storage space of 667 GB. You would most likely want to buy external storage for this console as many of its famous games are over 100 GB.</li>
                <li>Noisy fan</li>
            </ul>            
            <p>Another thing to investigate is that there are many exclusive PS5 games and Sony is trying to make more exclusive games. So if you want to play games such as “God of War” “Final Fantasy 16” “Ghost of Tsushima” “Horizon” and many others, you would want to play on the PS5. And if you enjoyed many games on their earlier consoles, many older PlayStation games are available in the PlayStation Store.</p>

            <h2>XBOX</h2>
            <img src="photos/xbox.webp" alt="image of xbox">
            <h3>PROS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>For the newest consoles there is the XBOX S and X giving players different options. XBOX S is smaller, costs around $299 dollars and has less graphics. But the X is larger, costs around $499 dollars and has more graphics.</li>
              <li>Lots of storage: the series X has 802 GB, and the series S has 450 GB</li>
              <li>Can play most older XBOX games</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CONS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Very few XBOX exclusive games. Most XBOX games can be played on the PC.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The XBOX has very few PROS and CONS, it makes it a lot easier for new gamers to use. It does have a wide variety of games to choose from. It has few exclusives but it has a cheaper option to use and the more expensive XBOX has more storage than a PS5.</p>
