            <h2>Switch</h2>
            <img src="photos/switch.webp" alt="picture of nintendo switch">
            <h3>PROS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>More family friendly and local games. Unlike the other console options, the Switch has a wide variety of games that are great for families, and parties.</li>
              <li>There are many games that are switch exclusive. </li>
              <li>Few versions of the Switch, giving customers a wide variety of price tags to choose from.</li>
              <li>Mobile. The Switch is the perfect choice for playing games on the go, you don’t need to connect it to a TV or monitor to enjoy games on this device, but if you want to play it on the TV, it is able to connect to one.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CONS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Joycon issues. The joycons on the Switch have a history of “drifting.” Drifting is when the joycon will act like its being pushed even though nothing is pushing it. Though annoying there are simply ways online to fix this problem.</li>
              <li>Price tags. The switch itself is cheaper than other consoles, but their games have very high price tags. They will range around $60 to $80 dollars per game.</li>
              <li>Addons. There are a lot of accessories you can buy for the switch. This can be seen as a PRO and CON depending on the person.</li>
              <li>The quality is not as great as other consoles. To make it mobile, light, and kid friendly, the switch has to sacrifice processing power. So games on this console cannot have as great graphics or gaming experience as they can on other consoles.</li>
              <p>For those looking into for a family friendly / kid friendly game, the Switch is highly recommended. Where it lacks in processing power, it thrives with the large variety of games that can only be played on the Switch.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>PC</h2>
            <img src="photos/pc.png" alt="image of computer">
            <h3>PROS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Flexibility. Obviously there are a large variety of computers for sale. From small computers built for offices to powerful computers that can play the best games with the highest graphics. There is always a PC that can fit any budget.</li>
              <li>Customizable: For those looking for a nice aesthetic to their gaming area the PC is the correct choice. There are hundreds of different styles to choose from.</li>
              <li>Buildable. For those wanting to learn more about electronics and computers, they could build themselves a computer for gaming, and for a smaller price tag as well.</li>
              <li>For those who work at home, their workplace can be their gaming station at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CONS:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The price tag. Weaker computers have a hard time running most games. So if a customer wants a computer that can play larger games, they will need a more powerful computer that can cost over $1000.</li>
              <li>Knowledge. You will need some knowledge on how computers work in order to play games on one. Lots of problems can happen to a computer because of gaming systems in it. </li>
              <li>Viruses. It is very easy to get a virus on a computer and can hurt the system badly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The PC is a great choice for those who know how to use them. It is not a great choice for beginners, but for those brave enough to choose PC gaming there are thousands of videos and tutorials online on how to use them. This choice is definitely an investment as it can take more money than consoles will.</p>
